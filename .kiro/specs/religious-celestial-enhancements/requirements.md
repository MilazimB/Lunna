6. WHEN calculating religious dates THEN the system SHALL respect local community customs and calculation preferences

### Requirement 5: Enhanced User Experience Features

**User Story:** As a user of the celestial calculator, I want additional helpful features like notifications, favorites, and educational content, so that I can get maximum value from the application for both practical and learning purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables notifications THEN the system SHALL send alerts for upcoming celestial and religious events
2. WHEN the user marks events as favorites THEN the system SHALL prioritize them in the display and notifications
3. WHEN viewing any astronomical event THEN the system SHALL provide educational explanations and cultural context
4. IF the user requests historical data THEN the system SHALL show past events and their significance
5. WHEN the user shares an event THEN the system SHALL generate formatted text with accurate timing and location data
6. WHEN using the app regularly THEN the system SHALL learn user preferences and customize the display accordingly

### Requirement 6: Location and Time Zone Management

**User Story:** As a user who travels or wants to check times for different locations, I want robust location management with automatic time zone handling, so that I can get accurate calculations regardless of where I am or where I'm planning to be.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes location THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and apply the correct time zone
2. WHEN calculating times for different locations THEN the system SHALL handle daylight saving time transitions accurately
3. IF the user saves multiple locations THEN the system SHALL allow quick switching between them
4. WHEN displaying times THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the time zone and any DST status
5. IF GPS is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide manual location entry with address lookup
6. WHEN the user is near time zone boundaries THEN the system SHALL warn about potential timing differences

### Requirement 7: Data Export and Integration

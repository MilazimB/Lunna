# Qibla Direction Feature

## Overview
The Qibla Direction feature provides Muslim users with a dedicated, full-screen compass view to determine the direction to Mecca for prayer. This feature has been separated from the prayer time cards to provide a more prominent and accessible experience.

## Components

### QiblaView
A standalone full-screen view that displays:
- Large, professional compass showing Qibla direction
- Current location information with coordinates
- Distance to Mecca (calculated using Haversine formula)
- Usage instructions
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop

**Location:** `components/QiblaView.tsx`

### QiblaCompass
A reusable compass component that visualizes the Qibla direction with:
- Circular design with cardinal direction markers (N, S, E, W)
- Degree tick marks at regular intervals
- Prominent green arrow pointing toward Mecca
- Numeric degree value and directional label (e.g., "137Â° SE")
- Smooth rotation animation
- Responsive sizing

**Location:** `components/QiblaCompass.tsx`

## Navigation

The Qibla feature is accessible via:
1. A dedicated button in the main navigation (ðŸ§­ Qibla Direction)
2. The button appears alongside Astronomical, Religious Schedule, and Calendar views
3. On mobile devices, it's available in the dropdown navigation menu

## Usage

Users can access the Qibla direction by:
1. Clicking the "Qibla Direction" button in the navigation
2. The view automatically calculates the direction based on the user's current location
3. The compass updates automatically when the location changes
